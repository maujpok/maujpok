### Hi there! I'm Mauricio Portillo ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full stack developer and write these lines from CÃ³rdoba, Argentina.

I'm a programmer passionate about new technologies, seeking at all times to incorporate new knowledge to be at the forefront of the IT world.

ðŸ’¡ I'm passionate about clean code, good practices, SOLID principles, developing quick reading and understanding code, which facilitate the scalability of the project.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as Full Stack Developer in an Argentine development company, solving frontend and backend requirements, using .NET, Angular, Flutter. With SCRUM and agile methodologies.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about AWS and Python. Recently finished trainings on .NET, Flutter, and Angular.

ðŸ’¡ Interesting facts: I worked the last 6 years in my own company, manufacturing sportswear to clients (clubs) throughout Argentina. This job gave me experience in digital marketing and sales, graphic design, team management and most of all, I became a complete proactive self-taught.

âš¡ Fun facts: I really like Ferrero Rocher's ice cream and in my  free time I play soccer pretending to be a professional footballer.ðŸ˜…

ðŸ’¯ And finally, most important of all, I'm looking for the opportunity to grow in the IT world, and to give my all to the company that gives me that opportunity.
