Hi! I'm Sabrina Vettorelo 👋
🔭 I’m currently working on a group project developing a web application for online professional services assistance.
🌱 I’m about to finish a coding bootcamp at Henry to be a Full Stack Developer.
✨ I’m looking for new challenges, expanding my programming skills, targeting web development. My goal is to use everything I have learned to solve problems wherever I might be, and keep on learning new things.
📫 How to reach me: sabrinavettorelo@gmail.com
💡 Interesting facts: I do not only code, my life experience has taken me from working in a research group, performing electrochemical experiments and mathematical modeling of reaction processes, to teaching in the School of Engineering where I graduate as Biomedical Eng.
