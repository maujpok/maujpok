Hi! I'm Sabrina Vettorelo ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a group project developing a web application for online professional services assistance.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m about to finish a coding bootcamp at Henry to be a Full Stack Developer.
âœ¨ Iâ€™m looking for new challenges, expanding my programming skills, targeting web development. My goal is to use everything I have learned to solve problems wherever I might be, and keep on learning new things.
ðŸ“« How to reach me: sabrinavettorelo@gmail.com
ðŸ’¡ Interesting facts: I do not only code, my life experience has taken me from working in a research group, performing electrochemical experiments and mathematical modeling of reaction processes, to teaching in the School of Engineering where I graduate as Biomedical Eng.
