ðŸ’¡ Interesting facts: I worked the last 6 years in my own company, manufacturing sportswear to clients (clubs) throughout Argentina. This job gave me experience in digital marketing and sales, graphic design, team management and most of all, I became a complete proactive self-taught.

âš¡ Fun fact: I like Ferrero Rocher ice cream so much and in my spare time I play soccer.

ðŸ’¯ And finally, most important of all, I'm looking for my first opportunity in the IT world, and to give my all to the company that gives me that opportunity.
